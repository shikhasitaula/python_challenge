## Overview
This project contains 2 sub-projects, PyBank and PyPoll. Both of the projects use the python script to manipulate different data sets. 

**PyBank** analyzes the financial records of a company in different months. It computes the total profit and the change in profit over the entire period of time. There are 3 main files in this project:

1. [Resources](https://github.com/shikhasitaula/python_challenge/tree/master/PyBank/Resources) : This folder stores a csv file named " budget_data.csv " that has been used in this analysis to find out the insighs on provided financial data. 
2. [analysis](https://github.com/shikhasitaula/python_challenge/tree/master/PyBank/analysis): This folder has a text file (PyBank_Result.txt) that contains the output of the python script excuted on the data set.
3. [main.py](https://github.com/shikhasitaula/python_challenge/blob/master/PyBank/main.py) : This is the python file containing the script to manupulate the data. 


**PyPoll** performs different computations on the election data. The logic here calculates the total votes cast, aggregats votes of different candidates. And finally, it helps to find out the winner candidate on the basis of vote count. The analysis contains with 3 files:
1. [Resources](https://github.com/shikhasitaula/python_challenge/tree/master/PyPoll/Resources):  This folder contains a csv file named " election_data.csv ". 
2. [analysis](https://github.com/shikhasitaula/python_challenge/tree/master/PyPoll/analysis): This folder has the text file (PyPoll_Result.txt) that contains the output after running a python script on election data set. 
3. [main.py](https://github.com/shikhasitaula/python_challenge/blob/master/PyPoll/main.py) : This is the python script containing the logic.
